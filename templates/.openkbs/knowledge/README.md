# OpenKBS Development Guidelines

## MANDATORY FIRST STEP

**READ EVERY SINGLE FILE IN THE EXAMPLES FOLDER**

Use the Read tool to read ALL files in `.openkbs/knowledge/examples/` directory and ALL subdirectories.

## Development Flow

1. **Read ALL example files first**
2. **Read existing code:**
   - `./app/` folder (settings, instructions, etc.)
   - `./src/` folder (all Events and Frontend files)
3. **Implement using knowledge from examples**

## Critical Rules

- Never skip reading examples
- Never guess framework methods - reference the examples
- Study the complete working applications in examples to understand OpenKBS patterns
